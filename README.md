# DDS-benchmark
Benchmarking for the Performance of Multi-Robot Networking Techniques and Data Distribution Service in Dynamic Topology
> This work performs tests on:
> - discovery time of four DDS (fast-DDS, openDDS, RTI connext and openSplice) in different network
> - discovety time of ROS2 with three DDS (fast-DDS, RTI connext and openSplice) in different network
> - communication performance of DDS and ROS2
